OOP is called a "programming paradigm"

Usually starts with a Class, which has 2 parts
    1. attributes (the things describing the class)
    2. methods (verbs, what the class can do)

Classes allow us to establish relationships between objects

ex of a class:
class Animal:
    """a simple note to describe the class"""
    def __init__(self, name, hunger, diet):  <-- "self" is basically this, what we're referring to
        self.name = name
        self.hunger = hunger
        self.diet = diet
    def eat():
        print("you better eat!")


Classes are basically like blueprints for a thing you want to create
